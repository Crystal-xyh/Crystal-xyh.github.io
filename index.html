						<h4>When Should Training & Housebreaking Begin?</h4>
						<p>
							Some people believe that young puppies (those less than 16 weeks of age) should not be exposed to any sort of a puppy training program. They feel that people should be using this time to simply allow the puppy time to get acquainted with her new home and family. They believe that this should be a totally unrestricted period, one with few rules so the puppy can widen her experiences at her own pace. Their thoughts often revolve around the concept that puppy training will have a harmful effect on the socialization process especially when discipline is used to define what is acceptable behavior and what is not. We disagree, and we do so possibly because of the training methods we believe in and utilize. Do not expect to read anything about training in this article that will cause your puppy mental or physical pain. We have no desire to frighten them, scold them into submission, or use our hands or any tool to hurt them. It is not our style.

						<h4>Litter Box Training for Your Kitten</h4>
						<p> As you get ready to bring a cat or kitten into your home, make sure you have all the things you will need to make your new pet feel welcome. Besides providing high-quality food, a safe environment, proper veterinary care, and lots of love, it is also important to give some thought to your cat's litter box. While this may not seem like a very important subject at first, the litter box can quickly become the major focus of your attention should your cat decide to stop using it. Elimination disorders are one of the biggest reasons for cats to be given up to shelters, and one of the most common problems for which people seek veterinary advice. </p>

						<h4>Housetraining Birds: Teaching Your Bird to Poop on Command</h4>
						<p>You have heard of house training cats, dogs, and even rabbits, but birds? Yes, some birds can be house trained. House training a bird means you are teaching him to "poop" on command. As with other animals, it takes commitment, patience, consistency, and positive reinforcement. Younger birds are generally easier to house train than older ones. Larger birds are generally easier to house train since they do not have to relieve themselves as often. A budgerigar (parakeet) may need to go three or four times an hour, whereas a large parrot can "hold it" several hours.</p>
