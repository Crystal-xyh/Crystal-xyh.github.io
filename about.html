					<h3>Foreword</h3>
					<p>
						Welcome to Pets World! I am the creator of this website. Here is some introduction of my website and me. I am a current student doing master of computing in ANU. You may think as a girl, doing computing subject is really rare. Even I have not leaned any knowledge about it before, but I love it. I had a wide range of interests, it is meaningless for me count here. What I want to say today, is some specific events will give us opportunities to develop new interests which we are not interested before.
					</p>
					<p>
						First, I will talk about my own story. During last several years, my family have adopted three dogs and more than fifteen cats. That's a fantastic thing for my family and I. However, adopting such amount of pets simultaneously is not easy, which will lead to my family to face problems sooner or later. When a female cat among these pets was pregnant and gave birth to 4 little catsï¼Œan unfortunate and frustrating event had occurred. As the female cat was the first time to be a mum, and nether my family nor I have any medical knowledge or experience of taking care of baby cats, which result in these 4 little cats all dead. This is the reason why I want to build a website about some medical knowledge of pets. Hope every one who has a pet is able to understand physical and psychological aspects of your pet, and is able to deal with emergency with your pet. Even a tiny unusual action of pets can not be ignored.
					</p>
					<p>
						Remember they are not only pets, but our friends. We should pay more attention to them to make sure that we accompany with them as long as possible.
